  graphical.  elements not produced by the
  \code{\link{plot}} command.}

  details.}

\description{
  This plot method can produce four different graphical
  summaries of the output of the \code{\link{fpcomSims}}
  function.

  \describe{

  \item{\code{plottype} equals \code{"distance"}}{A
  scatterplot of the phylogenetic versus functional
  distances between the species pairs are produced. Species
  numbers are used to label the points. The
  \code{\link{cophenetic}} function is used to compute the
  phylogenetic distances and the \code{\link{dist}}
  function is used to compute the functional Euclidean
  distances. Both distances are standardised such that the
  maximum distance is one.}

  \item{\code{plottype} equals \code{"traitgram"}}{A
  \code{\link{traitgram}} is produced, which combines both
  the phylogeny and the observed trait.}

  \item{\code{plottype} equals \code{"gradient"}}{A
  scatterplot of the probabilities of occurrence versus the
  observed gradient is produced.  The species are
  identified by their numbers. Note that these
  probabilities of occurrence depend only on the two
  gradients and the two traits, and therefore are not
  subject to variation among sites with identical gradient
  values. Such variation is expressed in the \code{comm}
  element of \code{fpcomSims} objects, which gives not
  probability of occurrence but occurrence itself. Note
  that if the \code{p} argument to \code{fpcomSims} is one,
  then only the observed trait and gradient determine
  probability of occurrence and the plot consists of
  perfect sigmoid curves.  But if \code{p} is zero then
  only the unknown gradient and trait determine probability
  of occurrence and the plot is just noise. In this latter
  case we would expect phylogenetic distance to provide
  more important information about communities.}

  \item{\code{plottype} equals \code{"ordination"}}{A
  special type of ordination of the species is produced.
  This ordination is based on the probabilities of
  occurrence and not on occurrence itself, and so it is
  able to fully explain all variation on two axes (if
  \code{p} is not either zero of one). Therefore, such an
  ordination is not possible in practice with real data but
  it is useful in this case for fully representing
  distances between species in species distribution space.
  Technically it is a singular value decomposition of the
  logit transformed probabilities of occurrence. Note well
  the percentages of variation explained by the two axes,
  and that this ordination is gauranteed to have 100
  percent of the variation explained by the first two
  axes.} }
