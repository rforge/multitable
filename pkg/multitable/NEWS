*************************************

BUG FIXES

	the print.data.list method was printing the 
	subsetdim attribute.  this is now fixed.

	when data.list was called with a single
	data frame and matrix, an error resulted
	whenever dim matching was to be done by
	matching dimnames even if the matrix and
	data frame were compatible.  this is now
	fixed.

*************************************

NEW FEATURES

	can specify the dimensions of new variables
	in a data list by referring to the dimensions
	of an existing variable, via the `shape`
	argument.

	better ?multitable help file with extensive
	examples that correspond to the vignette.

BUG FIXES

	previously the extraction functions made heavy
	use of the `substitute` function, which worked
	fine on current R but caused unwanted errors
	in older versions of R.  `bquote` is now used
	instead of `substitute`, which allows the
	extraction functions to work on more versions
	of R.
