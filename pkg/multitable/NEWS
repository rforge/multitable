*************************************
**				   **
**	multitable version 1.5	   **
**				   **
*************************************

NEW FEATURES

	added a read.matrix function for loading
	in data as a matrix (instead of as a
	data frame).  useful to keep track of
	whether a table of data should be added
	to a data list as a 2-dimensional
	variable or as a set of 1-dimensional 
	variables.
	

BUG FIXES

	fixed bug #2008: 'incompatible dimensions
	in y' error message called inappropriately

	fixed bug #2159: 'dlapply failing where it
	shouldn't'.  test added.

*************************************
**				   **
**	multitable version 1.4	   **
**				   **
*************************************

BUG FIXES

	the data.list print method in version 1.3 
	printed unnecessary information about the
	dimensions of replication.  this has been
	fixed.

	some fourth-corner problem data sets
	without dimnames were failing to be 
	created with data.list. the reason was
	because the condition indicating that
	dimnames should be matched (to produce
	the relationship structure) was TRUE,
	even though dimnames were not present.
	this has been fixed and many tests
	added.

	some silly unit tests were removed.

*************************************
**				   **
**	multitable version 1.3	   **
**				   **
*************************************

NEW FEATURES

	added two new functions, dropdl and dropl,
	that drop data list dimensions with only
	one level and null list elements
	respectively.

	added a data list method for the generic
	functions 'with' and 'within' in base.
	note that within.data.list is still
	considered experimental.

	added a dims_to_vars function that 
	creates new variables out of dimensions
	of replication.  i found myself doing
	this enough to warrant a function.

	added a utility function (not loaded to
	the namespace) called get.dimids, with a
	self explanatory purpose.

	added an argument 'placeholders' to 
	dlcast that allows cases to be ignored 
	(e.g. useful for when some sites in a 
	community ecology data set have no 
	species, in which case the empty site 
	can be dropped).  at the request of an 
	extremely helpful reviewer of the JSS
	paper.

	convenience functions variable and
	variableGroups for creating simple
	data lists.  particularly useful in
	conjunction with the + and - operators
	discussed below.

	the + and - operators now have methods
	for data lists to add variables to or 
	subtract variables from a data list.

	zombie factors in dimids columns of 
	data frames passed to dlcast are now
	included in the dimensions properly.
	unit tests added for this function.

	added a dlmelt function, which is an
	approximate inverse to dlcast.

	added a dlapply function, which is a
	multiple-table generalisation of the
	standard apply function in base R.

	some *slightly* better error messages.

BUG FIXES

	when the names of the variables of a data
	list were changed using the `names<-` 
	function, the corresponding names of the
	match.dimids attribute of the data list
	were left unchanged.  this bug 
	occassionally caused problems when trying 
	to use the shape argument in the 
	`[[<-.data.list` function because there is 
	a comparison between the shape argument 
	and the names of the match.dimids 
	attribute.  the bug was fixed by adding
	a specific `names<-` method for data 
	lists that explicitly changes the 
	match.dimids attribute names.

	fixed an issue with aperm.factor that 
	caused factor-valued variables in data
	lists to get out-of-order.

	fixed an internal problem with 
	make.match.dimids.  it wasn't identifying
	variables with NULL dimnames properly.

NEW DOCUMENTATION

	corrected an important error in the 
	documentation for the Extract.data.list 
	help file.  in particular the distinction
	between [[<-.default and [[<-.data.list
	is not properly described in the details
	section.

*************************************
**				   **
**	multitable version 1.2	   **
**				   **
*************************************

BUG FIXES

	the print.data.list method was printing the 
	subsetdim attribute.  this is now fixed.

	when data.list was called with a single
	data frame and matrix, an error resulted
	whenever dim matching was to be done by
	matching dimnames even if the matrix and
	data frame were compatible.  this is now
	fixed.

*************************************
**				   **
**	multitable version 1.1	   **
**				   **
*************************************

NEW FEATURES

	can specify the dimensions of new variables
	in a data list by referring to the dimensions
	of an existing variable, via the `shape`
	argument.

	better ?multitable help file with extensive
	examples that correspond to the vignette.

BUG FIXES

	previously the extraction functions made heavy
	use of the `substitute` function, which worked
	fine on current R but caused unwanted errors
	in older versions of R.  `bquote` is now used
	instead of `substitute`, which allows the
	extraction functions to work on more versions
	of R.
