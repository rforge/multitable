*************************************

NEW FEATURES

	can specify the dimensions of new variables
	in a data list by referring to the dimensions
	of an existing variable, via the `shape`
	argument.

	better ?multitable help file with extensive
	examples that correspond to the vignette.

BUG FIXES

	previously the extraction functions made heavy
	use of the `substitute` function, which worked
	fine on current R but caused unwanted errors
	in older versions of R.  `bquote` is now used
	instead of `substitute`, which allows the
	extraction functions to work on more versions
	of R.
