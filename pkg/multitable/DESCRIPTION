Description: Many data sets do not easily fit into a single data frame.
    Storing such data in a single data frame often results in either large
    numbers of meaningless missing values or storage of redundant information;
    yet storing them in multiple data frames often results in long
    difficult-to-read workflows.  The multitable package introduces a new data
    object called a data.list, which organises several data tables as a single
    R object.  The primary goal of multitable is to provide a more intuitive
    framework for manipulating multiple-table data in R.  As data.lists can be
    coerced to data.frames, they can be used with all R functions that accept
    an object that is coercible to a data.frame (e.g. lm; plot; lme; and many
    more).
